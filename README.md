This repository contains a suite of tools responsible for artifact promotion
in the Kubernetes project.


## DISCLAIMER

Before getting started, it's important to note that the tooling stored here
is an aggregate of several efforts to improve artifact promotion, across
multiple SIGs, subprojects, and contributors.

We call that out to set the expectation that:

- you may see duplicated code within the codebase
- you may encounter multiple techniques/tools for accomplishing the same thing
- you will encounter several TODOs
- you will see gaps in documentation including:
  - missing documentation
  - example commands that may not work
  - broken links

This list is far from exhaustive.

If you encounter issues, please search for existing issues/PRs in the
repository and join the conversation.

If you cannot find an existing issue, please file a detailed report, so that
maintainers can work on it.
